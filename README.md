# Happiness_Project

## Segment 1

### Presentation

**Topic:** World Happiness Report 2021

**Reason why we selected our topic:**  Our team explored various data sets such as Olympic data, Zilliow housing data, NBA player statistics and the World Happiness data.  

As we chatted about what insights we could gain from the analysis we decided the features and information available within the World Happiness data was what we wanted to explore.


**Description of source data:**
The World Happiness Report 2021 focuses on how people all over the world have coped with the effects of COVID-19.  The data set has two focuses, first the effects of COVID-19 on the structure and quality of peopleâ€™s lives, and second to describe and evaluate how governments all over the world have dealt with the pandemic. The purpose of the data is to help to try and explain why some countries have done better than others.


**Questions they hope to answer with the data:**
HELP!!!!!

**Description of the communication protocols:**
Our team has agreed to use Slack direct messages to communicate.  All members are aware and active on the message string that was created May 5, 2022.

**At least one branch for each team member:**
Completed May 10, 2022

**Data Sources:**
 - World Happiness Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021

## Final Deliverable Outline
- Project Overview
- Usage and installation instructions of libraries/tools that are used
- Intro (business question and motivation)
-  Group by world geographic regions: 
	* Which region had the highest happiness scores overall during 2021? (Bar Graph?)
	* What variables have the strongest impact on happiness scores for each region? (correlation plot)
	* How has the happiness score changed overtime for each region? (plot mean, maybe line plot?)
  * Is there a way to predict happiness scores based on the 7 variables provided? If so, what model can be used to accurately predict happiness? (Try Multiple Regression,   Decision Tree and Random Forest)
