## Segment 1

**Topic:** World Happiness Report 2021

**Reason why we selected our topic:**  Our team explored various data sets such as Olympic data, Zilliow housing data, NBA player statistics and the World Happiness data.  

As we chatted about what insights we could gain from the analysis we decided the features and information available within the World Happiness data was what we wanted to explore.
