- Project Overview
- Usage and installation instructions of libraries/tools that are used
- Intro (business question and motivation)
-  Group by world geographic regions: 
	* Which region had the highest happiness scores overall during 2021? (Bar Graph?)
	* What variables have the strongest impact on happiness scores for each region? (correlation plot)
	* How has the happiness score changed overtime for each region? (plot mean, maybe line plot?)
  * Is there a way to predict happiness scores based on the 7 variables provided? If so, what model can be used to accurately predict happiness? (Try Multiple Regression,   Decision Tree and Random Forest)
